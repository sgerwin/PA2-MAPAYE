## :beginner: Description/Given Problems

**1. NORMALIZATION PROBLEM**
   - create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X. Save your normalized ndarray as X_normalized.npy
<br>
**2. DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM**
   - given the 10x10 ndarray which are the squares of the first 100 positive integers.
   - Determine all the elements that are divisible by 3. Save the result as div_by_3.npy

## :green_circle: Getting Started

### :electric_plug: Dependencies

* Anaconda Navigator
* Jupyter Notebook
* Any updated version of Windows, Mac, or Linux that is capable of running the programs above.

### :wrench: Executing Program

* How to run the program
* In order to run each cell, please remember to press **_Shift + Enter_**
```
import numpy as np
```
* It is **_crucial_** to include __"import pandas as pd"__ as the entire Python script relies on this specific code.
